scrap hidden files

After looking at the whatever file in the robots.txt, we're now going to look at the .hidden files
We're going to create a scrapping script to retrieve all the text in one file(in python)

Once done, either use "grep -P '(?<!\d)\d{4}(?!\d)' results.txt" or simply CTRL + F a figit in the file to find the flag
