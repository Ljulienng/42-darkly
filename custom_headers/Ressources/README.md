Custom headers breach (referer and user-agent)

At the bottom of the header when clicking on the borntosec copyright it redirects us to this link
http://192.168.56.101/index.php?page=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f

When inspecting this page carefully we get those two interesting comments:

<!--
You must come from : "https://www.nsa.gov/".
-->

and:
Let's use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot.

it means that we have to access this page with https://www.nsa.gov/ as referer and ft_bornToSec as user-agent
notes:

Referer is an optional header field that allows the client to specify, for the serverâ€™s benefit, the address ( URI ) of the document (or element within the document) from which the URI in the request was obtained.

User agent is an HTTP header field gives the software program used by the original client

curl --referer "https://www.nsa.gov/" http://192.168.56.101/index.php\?page\=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f
we get this line:
FIRST STEP DONE<audio id="best_music_ever" src="audio/music.mp3"preload="true" loop="loop" autoplay="autoplay">

now let's add the user-agent:
curl --referer "https://www.nsa.gov/" --user-agent "ft_bornToSec" http://192.168.56.101/index.php\?page\=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f

Bingo we got the flag
